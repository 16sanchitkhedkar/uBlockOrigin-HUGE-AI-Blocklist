# uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist
A huge blocklist of sites that contain AI generated content.



## How to use the blocklist?

1. Make sure that you have the uBlock Origin Extension, either for [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) or [chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) (also works on Android)

2. Click on the uBlock Origin Extension, and in the bottom right, there is a cog-wheel symbol--named the dashboard. Click it.

3. Once you are in the dashboard, look towards the top. Click on the tab that says "Filter lists"

4. Look towards the bottom, and expand the ```Import``` button.

5. Copy and paste this url ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/main/list.txt``` into the dialogue box

6. Apply changes, and your set! The filter list should update as we discover more and more AI sites (and users).

### Some things to keep in mind

Because you are using one url, you won't be able to configure the filters yourself, so the default filter list will only be sites/users that are confirmed to have AI generated content displayed (and also some sites that mostly have AI generated content). 

Sites like Deviantart, Pinterest, Adobe Stock, etc. won't be blocked since they contain some authentic results, unless you add these into your filterlist manually.
