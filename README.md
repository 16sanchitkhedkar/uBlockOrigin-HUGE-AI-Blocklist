# uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist
A huge blocklist of sites that contain AI generated content, for the purposes of cleaning Google Image Search.



## How to use the blocklist?

1. Make sure that you have the uBlock Origin Extension, either for [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) or [chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) (also works on Android)

2. Click on the uBlock Origin Extension, and in the bottom right, there is a cog-wheel symbol--named the dashboard. Click it.

3. Once you are in the dashboard, look towards the top. Click on the tab that says "Filter lists"

4. Look towards the bottom, and expand the ```Import``` button.

5. Copy and paste this url ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/main/list.txt``` into the dialogue box.

6. Apply changes, and your set!

A video guide on how to do this is available, as well:

uBlock Origin will automatically refresh the filter list once a day, so you'll always have up-to-date filters. If you want to force an update of the filter list, pressing the stopwatch next to the newly added list, then pressing ```Update now``` will achieve that.

### Additional list(s)

As of right now, there are two lists. The main default list, and the nuclear list. The nuclear list has sites that contain a mix of authentic and AI generated imagery, which make it tricky to outright block in the main filter list, so I've designated it to a separate list that you can toggle on and off if you so desire.

In order to use the list, do the same steps that you did in the section "How to use the blocklist", but instead of using the other url, use ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/main/additional_list_nuclear.txt```

There ya go! Happy searching and happy new year to all!!
